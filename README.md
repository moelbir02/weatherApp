# weatherApp
This is my project a Weather app in Vanilla Javascript, css and HTML without the use of any libraries. 
I use the Open Weather Map API to make calls to a restful api to return the current weather data. This uses the Modern Javascript Fetch API.
The 3 features that i am using in this WeatherApp are :
   1- Retrieve data from an external API and display data. 
   2- Calculate and display data.
   3- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field.
